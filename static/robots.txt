# For .well-known, you might want to be more specific.
# If you don't use .well-known at all:
Disallow: /.well-known/
# If you use it for specific things like ACME challenges for SSL, you might do:
# Allow: /.well-known/acme-challenge/
# Disallow: /.well-known/ # (This would then block other .well-known paths)

# Disallow all PHP files for all user agents, matching your Python filter.
Disallow: /*.php$

# IMPORTANT: Default stance on crawling other parts of your site
# If your main content (like index.html and what's in your sitemap) should be crawled:
Allow: /
# If you prefer to block everything by default and only allow specific good paths:
# Disallow: /
# Allow: /index.html  (example)
# Allow: /some-other-public-page.html (example)
# Allow: /static/ (if your static assets are here and needed by crawlers, though usually not necessary if linked from allowed HTML)

# Ensure search engines can find your sitemap
